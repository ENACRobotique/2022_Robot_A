This directory is intended for PlatformIO Unit Testing and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

Jonathan Opinion :
Don't need unit test with mockable functions because 
the firmware will only really be low level.
(Unit test only complex things, like string handling & calculations)

Test_embedded need to be tested with STM32L476RG plugged.
